# BiSinger: Bilingual Singing Voice Synthesis (ASRU2023)

### Audio Samples
**Our offical site: https://bisinger-svs.github.io** presents experimental synthesized audio samples, providing our data adaptation demo, as well as case study.

### Code & Data
Due to the restrictions of the commercial speech dataset, DB-4, we only provide the our source code acompanied with documentation conducting data adaptation.

**We are gradually organizing and updating the open-source code, and we appreciate your understanding and attention. Rest assured, we are working diligently to complete it as soon as possible.**
